## (upcoming release)

 * fix: support only latest (3.x) `mocha` versions ([#98](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/98))

## 1.2.8

 * fix: do not fail if no target is set and `--recursive` option is used ([#94](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/94))

## 1.2.7

 * fix: add support for `xdescribe`, `xcontext`, `xspecify`, `xit` and `it.skip` ([#102](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/102))
 * most of packages dependencies upgrade (minor changes)

## 1.2.6

 * fix: tests with binary dependencies can now be used with `mocha-parallel-tests` ([#100](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/100))

## 1.2.5

 * fix: if file contains multiple `describe()` sections in it, one of it fails and `mocha-parallel-tests` is executed with `--retry` option, only this failed section is re-executed ([#77](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/77))

## 1.2.4

 * fix: `--no-exit` CLI option is supported ([#85](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/85))

## 1.2.3

 * fix: pwd-based reporters (located somewhere inside your repo) are supported ([#75](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/75))

## 1.2.2

 * fix: `selenium-webdriver` issue with number of tests is fixed ([#69](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/69)). Currently all `selenium-webdriver` tests should work as expected.

## 1.2.1

 * fix: `--require`'d files are working as expected together with `--compilers` option ([#63](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/63))

## 1.2.0

 * **new**: using mocha-parallel-tests programmatically is now supported. You can also pass own mocha-parallel-tests options by calling `setOwnOptions({maxParallel, retry})` method of mocha-parallel-tests instance. You should call it before `run()`.

## 1.1.x

 * **breaking change**: `mocha` is now in peerDependencies part of `mocha-parallel-tests` which means that you need to add both `mocha` and `mocha-parallel-tests` in your project's package.json. This also means that you can run both of your tests: written for mocha@2.x and mocha@3.x ([#55](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/55))
 * fix: support for only() and skip() helpers ([#59](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/59))
 * fix: main package file now refers to CommonJS file, not ES6 module.

Version number is 1.1.0 because first `mocha-parallel-tests` releases had 1.0.x versioning scheme.

 * fix: global hooks stored inside separate files are now executed if target is directory ([#41](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/41))
 * fix: global hooks stored inside separate files are now executed ([#39](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/39))

## 0.4.x

 * **new**: support for mocha `--compilers` option introduced
 * fix: tests using `--max-parallel=1` run without errors ([#34](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/34))
 * fix: reporters with own options like `xunit` don't produce errors now ([#31](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests/issues/31))

## 0.2.x

 * **new**: `--retry <num>` to set number of retries for failing tests (0 by default)
